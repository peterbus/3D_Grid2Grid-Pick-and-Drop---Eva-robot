# 3D_Grid2Grid-Pick-and-Drop---Eva-robot
Pick and drop scenario for Automata Eva robot. Extension of the previous Automata 2D Grid class into 3D Grid, operating with 3D dimensional space. The robot picks and drops between two 3-dimensional grids, continuously from one to another. Tested with Eva SDK 4.0.0., using the slower motion. The dimensions of the grids need to be tested, depending of the sizes of objects the robot pics and drops.  The scenario operates with small prisms, dimensions: 7 x 5 x 3.5 cm (in thickness). 
The robot utilises popular gripper Schunk EGP 40 with customised jaws.
