# 3D_Grid2Grid-Pick-and-Drop---Eva-robot
Pick and drop scenario for Automata Eva robot. Extension of the previous Automata 2D Grid class into a 3D Grid, operating with three-dimensional space. The robot picks and drops objects between two 3-dimensional grids, continuously from one to another. Tested with Eva SDK 4.0.0., using the slower motion. The dimensions of the grids need to be tested, depending of the sizes of objects the robot pics and drops.  The scenario operates with small prisms, dimensions: 7 x 5 x 3.5 cm (in thickness). Such a scenario can be used for building simple spatial  models.
The robot utilises popular gripper Schunk EGP 40 with customised jaws.
